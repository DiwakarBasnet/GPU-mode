## ðŸš€ Progress

### Day-01
Today I read chapter 1 of the book, which includes need for parallel computing and its benefits.
- [x] Difference in architecture of a CPU and a GPU
- [x] Hello world program in CPU
- [x] Hello world program in GPU

### Day-02
Today I read chapter 2 of the book, "*Heterogeneous data parallel computing*"
- [x] Function declarations (`kernel function`, `device function`, `host function`)
- [x] Built-in variables (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`)
- [x] Kerne call and grid launches (```<<<gridDim, blockDim>>>```)
- [x] CUDA vector addition

### Day-03
Today I learnt about creating kernels for operating on multidimensional arrays.
- [x] Kernel for converting color of image to grayscale
- [x] Kernel for image blur effect
- [x] Square matrix multiplication in CUDA
